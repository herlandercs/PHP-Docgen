## PHP Docgen

Docgen is a framework for allowing you to gather information about your PHP source code and create maintainable,
automatically generated documentation from it.

One of Docgen's main aims is to be hackable. Not only is it open source but it has a powerful and easy to leverage
plugin framework that you can use to do a huge range of interesting things. For some examples, see the existing plugins
:)
