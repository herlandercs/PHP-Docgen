PHP Docgen
==========

Work in progress.

TODO
====

I accidentally created two test directories. Pick one, Sam.

Need to write tests.

Need to look closer at the Docgen_Application and make it into an abstract class for users to implement.

Currently, the Docgen_CodeSearch class only finds one class per file. This isn't necessarily the case in some codebases.

The Docgen_CodeSearch class could probably use some extra helpful methods, too. For finding functions, maybe.

Need to write tutorials and stuff so people actually know what to do.

Lots of love,
Sam
