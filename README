PHP to RST Documentation Generator
==================================

Work in progress. The idea is to take a list of classes and translate them into rST. The code is written in a way that
will make it possible to create any format, though, not just rST.

TODO
====

The code is in dire need of commenting. I blasted through it this morning ^_^

Some refactoring here and there wouldn't go amiss.

Some documentation on the values you have access to in the .tpl files.

I think that's about it. You'll need some code-fu to adapt this to your own project but it really isn't that tough, I'll
document the process properly soon :)

Lots of love,
Sam
